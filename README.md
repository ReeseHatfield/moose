    A name-driven year estimator

## What is Moose:
Moose is birth year estimator based on names. It exists to solve a very niche problem
I kept running into in genealogy, where people archive yearbook photos with names, but never 
include the dates. This only happened a handful of times, but historical based year estimation based on
fashion is not something I am very skilled at.

## How does it work?:
Moose uses first-name relative rank estimations based on data from the US Social-Security Administration.
Names rise and fall in popularity over time, so if you have a group of names of people all born around approximately the same time,
you can use Moose to estimate a birth year based on their names.

With the natures of the SSA's data, moose tends to predict the earliest year. So add a few years for a more accuratae range of time
